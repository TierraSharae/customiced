# Customiced üê≠

'twas the night before a career fair, and i decided to spend a few hours on a no-frills, interactive, responsive site for Customiced, my term project for a product design course at Penn over the summer.

as i continue to work on this fun piece, i'm interested in seeing how it looks on your device and browser. feel free to send me a screenshot or email me any issues you encounter!
